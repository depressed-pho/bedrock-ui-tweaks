# Bedrock UI Tweaks

**Bedrock UI Tweaks** is a resource pack for Minecraft Bedrock which
  provides small tweaks to its UI.

Features:

* Remove the "How to play" button from the inventory screen for Pocket
  UI. It's really easy to mistap the button in an attempt to tap
  somewhere else, especially the close button.
* Remove animations from the "Marketplace" button on the startup
  screen. Its style is way too inconsistent with other buttons and is
  very distracting. The pack also removes "New!" and "Sale!"  icons
  attached to it.
* Reorder the server list so that manually added servers come first.
