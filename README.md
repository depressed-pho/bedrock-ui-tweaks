# Bedrock UI Tweaks

**Bedrock UI Tweaks** is a resource pack for Minecraft Bedrock which
  provides small tweaks to its UI.

Features:

* Remove the "How to play" button from the inventory screen for Pocket
  UI. It's really easy to mistap the button in an attempt to tap
  somewhere else, especially the close button.
* Remove animations from the "Marketplace" button on the startup
  screen. Its style is way too inconsistent with other buttons and is
  very distracting. The pack also removes "New!" and "Sale!"  icons
  attached to it.
* Remove the "Marketplace" button from the pause screen. There is
  absolutely no reason why a player would want to buy products while
  they're pausing.
* Reorder the server list so that manually added servers come first. When a
  player manually adds a server to the list, they do so because they want
  to join it. Pushing additional servers down the scroll is therefore
  nonsensical.
* Remove the button for subscribing to Realms that is shown in the list of
  local worlds. When a player wants to enter their local world, there is
  hardly any reason to remind that they can subscribe to Realms.
