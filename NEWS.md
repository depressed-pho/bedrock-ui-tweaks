# Release notes

## 1.2.2

* Updated for Minecraft Bedrock 1.19.10.
* Removed the "How to play" button from the Stonecutter, Cartgraphy, and
  the Loom UI.

## 1.2.1

* Moved the "Add Server" button right below the list of additional
  servers.

## 1.2

* Reordered the left panel in the "Servers" tab. Additional servers
  come first, featured servers go last. When a player manually adds a
  server to the list, they do so because they want to join it. Pushing
  additional servers down the scroll is therefore nonsensical.

## 1.1.1

* Fixed a button "Unlock Full Game" being shown on 1.16 even if you
  have a full version.
* Removed the animation from the "Marketplace" button.

## 1.1

Enhancements:

* Removed the "New!" and "Sales!" icons from the startup screen.

## 1.0

The first release.
